          After **15 years** building websites and UI's ourselves, we wanted to
          **improve the way teams collaborate** when creating web frontends.
          That's why we started **kickstartDS.**


          We want to share our experience and offer a **huge library** of best practice **patterns** and well tested **web components**. All the while following the principles of the Atomic Design methodology.


          That's why **kickstartDS** really is a ready to use framework, to support people and organizations building design systems and digital touchpoints.


          It **prevents** developers from **wasting time** setting up the basics, while it **enables designers** to focus on tricky UI challenges.

          More than 20 years ago I started creating user interfaces and web
          style guides, corporate design manuals and in the past years the first
          digital design systems. 


          After working in a large tech corporation for a long time I very well know todays problems in **gaining and maintaining consistency** in UIs. Whilst organizing the regional [UX meetup](http://uxbn.de) I heard so many design and dev teams complaining on the same frontend problems. 


          That was the reason I co-founded **kickstartDS**. Knowing that we can create a tremendous value for all these frontend creators and the companies they are working for.


          I am convinced that both parties will benefit from using our solution within their tool chain. And I am more than happy to hear your story!
